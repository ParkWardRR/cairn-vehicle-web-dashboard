# tsdb) and by the production cutover check.
#
#   ui/tests/walk-routes.sh [--empty] http://localhost:3100
#
# --empty is for a store with no trips: 400, 404 and 503 (no boot to ask about, nothing to show, no snapshot)
# then count as answered as designed. Against a populated store they are failures.
# A 404 that is the server saying it has no such route at all ("Page not found: ")
# is never as designed: a route that went missing must not hide behind an empty store.
#
# Exit 0 only if every route answered 2xx. Routes with a parameter other than :bootId
# are skipped (they need a place id the caller owns); POST/PATCH/DELETE are not walked.
